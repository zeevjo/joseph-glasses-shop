## About

This project is a fully functional and responsive e-commerce website designed for a glasses shop. The site includes a hero section, product pages, and a navbar & footer. It also implements animations and transitions to make the site interactive.

## Features

### Home Page

1. **Navigation Bar**:
   - Links to various sections of the home page.
   - Located at the top for easy accessibility.

2. **Hero Section**:
   - Video playing in the background.
   - Text overlay to captivate user attention.

3. **Products Section**:
   - A section of products.
   - Each product links to a dedicated product page.

4. **Footer**:
   - Social media links at the bottom of every page.

### Product Page

1. **Product Image**:
   - Displays a clear image of the product.

2. **Price and Options**:
   - Lists the product price and available options (defined by colors).

3. **Back Button**:
   - Redirects the user to the home page.

4. **Bonus Feature**:
   - Clicking on a product options (color) changes the product image dynamically.

### Transitions

- Smooth animations implemented across the site for user interaction.

1. On :hover over a link in the navbar (on a laptop or wide screen), a line will transition under the link.

2. On :hover over a social media icon in the footer, it will transition upwards by 5px.

3. On :hover over the glasses image, it will transition by zooming in. Additionally, hovering over a color choice button will transition by scaling its size.

4. On :hover over the "Home" button on the single item page (after clicking a product on the home page), the button will transition from left to right with a blue background and cream text color.

- There are more animations and transitions throughout the project.
 however, I specifically mentioned these four to make them easy to identify, as the task requires four different transitions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup for structuring the site.
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, and animations.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the site looks great on all devices.
